Greatest Common Divisor


The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.

Here, 8 and 12 both are divisible by 4. There is no number greater than 4 which 8 and 12 are both divisible with.

Examples
GCD(2, 4) => 2

GCD(1, 5) => 1

GCD(3, 6) => 3

GCD(4, 12) => 4

GCD(6, 14) => 2

Given two numbers, calculate their GCD.

Testing
Input format
